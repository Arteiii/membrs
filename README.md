to set up the latest release, you can use the executable from the GitHub Release page

the installer currently only supports linux

to download and directly run it, you can use:

```shell
curl -O -L https://github.com/arteiii/membrs/releases/latest/download/membrs && chmod +x membrs && sudo ./membrs
```

### Podman

since podman doesn't change ur actual firewall configurations make sure to update them yourself


## Description

As I am incredibly annoyed by projects that are hard to set up, 
I will do my best to make it as easy as possible.
Currently, planned is an installer (membrs bin) that installs all dependencies and prerequisites for you.
